# JavaSuperMarioGame

A 2D Super Mario game I tried to make in Java a few years ago. It only has one playable level and is a bit unpolished, but it is playable from start to finish.

To start the game, run the Runnable class in the Game package when launching the application in the IDE. When the game has booted up, use the mouse and press the start button for playing, and press the quit button for exiting the application.

Controls:
  - Movement: Arrow buttons (left & right)
  - Jump: Space
  - Run: Left Shift
  - Pause/Menu: Esc
